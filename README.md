REAL_CALCULATOR
<br>
Tried to make a basic calculator only using basic java.
<br>
This is basic calculator works just as good as any phone calculator.
<br>
Operates with +,-,*,/, and().
<br>
Uses BODMAS Rule.
<br>
When Running the the code plese give input carefully(tuough it has a very fine exception handling. If input is wrong it will give error massage until you put a proper input.).
<br>
Press enter after every input just as you do while running code in any IDE or Terminal.
